# Penguin

Learning CSS transforms by building a penguin.

You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use tranforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this project, I've used CSS transforms to position and resize te parts of the penguin, create a background, and animate the work.
